    <p>PDD-NOS is a type of autism where individuals display some, but not all, of the characteristics of autism spectrum disorders.

Children with CDD typically develop normally for the first few years of life before experiencing a sudden regression in multiple areas of development. Challenges include profound difficulties in communication, social interaction, and adaptive functioning.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="autism-type">
    <h2>4. Rett Syndrome</h2>
